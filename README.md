# XiaomiEuRomChecker
Web application for checking for the latest weekly and/or stable xiaomi.eu MIUI 14 roms in sourceforge cloud folders.

All users will have:
- access to the available devices list
- an option to get info about selected device
- access to the download links section
- send me emails for unsupported or new devices in xiaomi.eu that can be removed/added from the site database
- The contact form has captcha in order to sort the real users from bots
  
Registered users will have additional options:
- CRUD for the links
- option to shorten the links with bit.ly API

Staff users will have an option to use Admin panel based on their permissions

 You can check the demo here: https://chebishev.pythonanywhere.com/
 It will be disabled on Thursday 02 November 2023, so I made a deploy on AWS:

The project is inspired and based on the functionality of this repo (also mine):
